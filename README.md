# Haskell Nix dev template
A template for completely reproducile build and development experience using Nix.

## Motivation
I find setting up a Haskell project way more complicated than nearly any modern language.
I decided to make once and for all a way for beginners such as myself to start playing with Haskell quickly without spending so much time thinking about the IDE.

## The philosophy

* Use Nix to handle packages (Haskell compiler, development tools).
* Use Cabal for the Haskell package definition.
* The development can be started after only a few commands in CLI (3 at most).
